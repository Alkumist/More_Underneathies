Underneathies 1.1.0
===================

Version 1.1.0 was released December 1, 2020, was tested using Factorio v1.1.3, and was authored by Supercheese, based on the Reddit thread by Dynamic_Gravity.

This mod changes the names of Underground Belts into "Underneathies". That's it. No more, no less.

Compatibility for Bob's Mods is also included.
